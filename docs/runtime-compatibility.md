# Runtime Compatibility

## Current Policy

- Plugin artifact: `jp.igapyon:miku-indexgen-maven-plugin:1.2.0`
- Runtime artifact: `jp.igapyon:miku-indexgen:1.2.0`
- Version policy: keep the plugin version aligned with the compatible runtime
  version unless a future release explicitly documents a mismatch.

## Local Runtime Setup

Until the runtime artifact is available from a remote Maven repository, install
it from the local runtime checkout:

```bash
mvn -f ../miku-indexgen-java/miku-indexgen/pom.xml install
```

This command writes Maven artifacts to the local Maven repository. It should
not be treated as a source change to the runtime repository.

## Verification

Use:

```bash
mvn test
sh scripts/smoke-maven-plugin.sh
```

The smoke script verifies full-coordinate invocation for both plugin goals.
